## Software Engineer | Backend Architectures & AI Systems

Software Engineer specializing in the design of scalable, high-performance systems under **Clean Architecture** and **Hexagonal Architecture** paradigms. My professional focus centers on orchestrating robust solutions that align business requirements with technical excellence, strategically integrating **Generative AI** capabilities to optimize critical operational processes.

### Engineering Pillars & Technical Rigor

* **Architecture & System Design:** Implementation of architectures based on **decoupled layers** to ensure a strict **separation of concerns**. I strategically select the technical approach—including **Hexagonal Architecture** fundamentals—based on system requirements and complexity, prioritizing modularity and business logic isolation to ensure scalable and testable systems.
* **Security & Compliance:** Development grounded in **official documentation** and industry standards. I apply a **Security-by-Design** approach, prioritizing systemic resilience and protection against attack vectors from the initial design phase.
* **Generative AI & Data Ecosystems:** Specialization in orchestrating **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures and managing vector databases (**Milvus**) for the efficient processing of technical information flows.
* **Quality & SDLC:** Commitment to delivering software free of technical debt through **Automated Testing** strategies (Unit & Integration) and Continuous Integration (CI/CD) processes to ensure production-grade stability.
